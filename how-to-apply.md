# How to Apply

Due to the volume of students now applying to this internship, to be eligible you must [fill out the RCP Student Internship Enrollment form](https://redcap.wehi.edu.au/surveys/?s=AMYXK9FFHXR9LE9T). 

You can see the [intake dates here](intake_dates).

This is because we now need to streamline our applications and ensure no students are missed in the application process. To do this we need to move from a a manual process to this more automated process. We appreciate that there may be some confusion but any applicants will be redirected to this form as it takes precedence over any other application method.
