# Email - Week 2

Hi All,

This is your email to start week 2 of your internship. You are probably getting your head around the concepts and perhaps still feeling a little bit anxious too. That’s OK. Please remember that this is a “best-effort” internship for most of you and we are trying to see how good you really are in a safe environment. Remember, you can always ask your supervisor or me for help.


## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).


## Goals for the week

1. Read the Student Project Outline and attend the daily standups as often as you can. Ask your teammates to answer questions at the daily standups if you can't make it.
2. Setup Workday (if available) based off the information in [the Onboarding onto the Internship program FAQ](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#onboarding-onto-the-internship-program-workday)
3. Setup a weekly template email update to send to your supervisors one day before the weekly meeting. This should be the standard across all the future weekly project meetings. Usually, students who do not send regular email updates usually do not do well and do not receive good references by their supervisors.
4. Schedule two regular co-working sessions per week with your fellow student interns, without supervisors. These can be used so you can work together. The second co-working session should be co-ordinated with your sister project. A sister project is a project that is working on a similar set of technology to you that you would regularly talk to.
5. Create a technical diary folder on Sharepoint/Teams and add a link from the onboarding page of the wiki to the technical diary folder. Add your technical diary into this folder, you can use a word document. Please put in this diary any presentations, documents, or internet sites you watch and include a summary to help you remember later on.
6. You also might want to create a document registry to keep track of all the documents that you create or come across.
7. You should have your WEHI address added to the Sharepoint/Teams "WEHI-wide student intern group". If you haven't, please add it by following the ["How do I get access to the WEHI-wide student intern group using my WEHI email address?"](faq#how-do-i-get-access-to-the-wehi-wide-student-intern-group-using-my-wehi-email-address) FAQ
8. You should have been sent a calendar invite to your personal/university email about the week 4 activity of drawing the high-level problem on the whiteboard , the week of practice presentations and submission of summary reports, and the week of final presentations.
9. Read [the Social Media Policy for student interns](social_media_policy).
10. Get a feel for what you need for the whiteboard presentation for week 4. Here is [an example of drawing up the high level problem on a virtual whiteboard WEHI email access only](https://wehieduau.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/StudentInternGroupatWEHI/Shared%20Documents/Student%20Organiser/2024-03%20Rowland%20thoughts%20on%20Student%20organiser-20240302_110318-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=dtm4hd).

You can see the full list in [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).

## Key things to do before for your regular weekly project meeting

1. Please meet as a team before the meeting without your supervisors to ensure you as a team of students are all on the same page
2. Please send a weekly email update 24 hours before the meeting with: 
  - what each student has done,
  - write down any questions you have for the meeting to use as an agenda,
  - provide a link to the wiki, and 
  - provide a link to the technical notes in Sharepoint
3. Remember to ask to record the meeting to more easily keep notes if needed
4. Document the action items and make sure they are in the weekly email update for next week
