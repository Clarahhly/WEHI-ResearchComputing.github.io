# BioNix

The challenge that we were trying to solve was reproducibility issues in bioinformatics workflows, such that any two systems could produce the same output with the same input. Computing environments will rarely be equal amongst bioinformaticians, and so outputs on the same software will also tend differ between individuals. A multitude of factors can contribute to this – inclusive of (but not limited to) system configurations and dependency updates or version mismatch – and as such a solution calls for unification of workflows under one consistent environment umbrella. This is the BioNix project at its core, improving upon or otherwise reinforcing reproducibility in existing bioinformatics tools under Nix to maintain repeatable outputs.

The way we tried to solve this was by utilising Nix, a declarative, functional package manager built from the ground up for reproducibility and reliability. In short, Nix ensures reproducibility by building packages using only the specified dependencies (and dependency versions) in complete isolation from each other. The main crux of our project focussed around the VIRUSBreakend software, more specifically, its dependencies of Kraken2 and RepeatMasker. We developed derivations of these dependencies in Nix, wrapping and shipping them to nixpkgs, an open-source repository of packages.

Through this process, we learned how to Nix, constructing wrappers for software that benefit greatly from reproducibility. We developed an appreciation for the high-level concepts and functions of the system, and were able to understand the importance of this knowledge when tackling difficult problems. We continuously faced open-source norms towards the end of the project, and so constructing a solid grasp on how we should tailor our work for integration into a public repository such as nixpkgs was also incredibly useful.

# RAG LLM

One of the existing problems with the onboarding process for the internship is that our supervisor is handling 38 interns by himself and he would receive repeated questions from students. Another problem we are solving is the difficulty in finding answers to a question due to the large number of existing WEHI websites, resources and documentation. Although the previous intake has built a chatbot that is functional, the accuracy is at 75% which may cause distrust in the user, and they may avoid using the system. Ultimately, interns will resort back to asking the supervisor questions.  

Hence, due to RAG LLM’s inconsistent results, we focused on finding strategies to improve the trust of a user in the chatbot system. We attempted to solve this by implementing a system that allows users to choose different search methods (keyword, semantic and RAG LLM) to receive an answer to their queries. We also incorporated extra mechanisms to enhance the system, such as logging all queries and answers for our supervisor to track. Additionally, as the previous intake provided two sets of architecture for the chatbot, we experimented and decided on an architecture that combines the two, taking the best from both within computational limits.  

We have learned how to build a versatile architecture by making each of layer of the architecture independent. Doing so, we can interchange the search methods without needing to build a new architecture. Besides that, we have learned how to prioritize tasks effectively to ensure that we achieve as much as we can in the short time frame. For instance, we have decided to use a third-party template for user interface to reduce the time spent on that component to focus on enhancing the accuracy of the chatbot.
